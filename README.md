# COVID_detector_transfer_learning
Predicting whether given x ray image is covid affected by fine tuning  VGG16 net 
Dataset is already divided into test and train distributions but it is suitable for transfer learning as it contains total of 200 x-ray images of hwalthy and covid affected lungs
I intend to further increase it's accuracy and also implement it using some other CNN's
